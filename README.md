# About Me.

## My Interests
	* I have 3 cats, all girls, whose names are Juno, Lemon, and Toph; they're basically permanent toddlers, but they definitely keep my life interesting.
	* I love my bartending job! Definitely not going to do it forever, but it's incredibly fun and pretty good money.
	* I just finished _Cyberpunk Edgerunners_ on Netflix and it's easily a Top 10 show for me at the moment.
	* My favorite color is green and my lucky numbers are 13 and 21.

## Websites I Recommend
	* [2048] (https://play2048.co/) - I love this website and this game.  It's an easy way to kill time, while also having to actually use your brain a little bit.  
	* [The Deep Sea] (https://neal.fun/deep-sea/) - Want to learn about how deep the ocean really is? This website scrolls for what feels like forever while giving really cool facts about the ocean, human limits, and what animals reside at what depths.  Fun fact: the deepest a human has scuba dived is 332 meters.
